    "habitat": "On all kind of hardwood, often on buried roots, more rarely on conifers.Saprotrophic, causes white-rot, most of all in the roots of deciduous trees. Growing solitary or in smaller groups. Its main fruiting season is Late Summer to Autumn, but it can be found during the whole year.",
    "possible_confusion": "Young, irregular fruit bodies secrete/oozing red droplets. In this form it can be confused with Devil’s Tooth (Hydnellum peckii) and/or Mealy Tooth (Hydnellum ferrugineum), but both species can be found exclusively in old conifer forests, near Pine or Spruce, also these species have spines (teeth), not wide pores.The regular fruit bodies might be confused with the rarer Zoned Rosette (Podoscypha multizonata), pictured, which also prefers hardwoods, especially Oaks, but Zoned Rosette doesn’t have visible pores.

It could be hemispherical with its pores upside-down, but even if it forms its regular, rosette form, the so-called ‘rosecomb mutation’ is rather common. In mycology, the term ‘rosecomb mutation’ is used when any kind of distortions, lumps or malformations occur on the cap and makes visible the gills or the pores.Itsepithet(the 2nd part of the scientific name which identifies the species within the genus) –biennis– suggests it is biennial, but it is incorrect, and likely based on the really variable appearance of this species.",

The ridges on the Black Morel also become darker than the rest of the cap with age, unlike the paler ridges of Yellow Morels.The Common Morel (Morchella vulgaris) is very closely related to the Morel. It is usually more grey in colour specially when young. The ridges of the cap are thicker and the pits are more irregular and labyrinthic in shape. The Morel has thinner edges and polygonal shaped pits. Intermediate forms exist that may be hard to differentiate at the very young or very mature stage.The “Morels” are a large group (technically called acladeorsection) of very similar species, and mycologists still  haven’t established exactly how many species exist, their distribution, and how they differ from each other.

Also the cap of the Devil’s Bolete being a chalky white but this is less reliable as the cap can fade on older Scarletina Boletes.Deceiving bolete (Suillellus queletii) also has dots on the stem but they’re yellow to buff/grey and not red.

Modern DNA studies split Boletusinto smaller genus allocating this one in Neoboletus. More recently it came to light that the name “erythropus” had been previously used for a different species of Bolete which makes the name scientifically invalid.  Recent books list it as “Neoboletus luridiformis” but “luridiformis” isn’t a valid name under scientific rules either, and apparently “Boletus praestigiator” was the first valid description of this species. Newer books published after 2017 should be naming it as “Neoboletus praestigiator“. Furthermore, the Neoboletusgroup has a second species, currently named Neoboletus xanthopus, that is extremely similar to the Scarletina Bolete and impossible to differentiate without a DNA analysis. Thankfully this second species is equally edible and it’s irrelevant to a forager to distinguish them so we treat the whole group here under Scarletina Bolete.",

    "possible_confusion": "The False Morel (Gyromitra esculenta), pictured, but this is more lobed or brain-like rather than the pitted and honeycomb like cap of the morel. The False Morel also differs in not having a completely hollow cap.The Stinkhorn (Phallus impudicus) can also look similar to those who are unfamiliar with it, but the strong foul smell quickly denounces its identity. It appears in Summer and Autumn when Morels are no longer around.The Morel (Morchella esculenta) or Common Morel (Morchella vulgaris) can look similar, even in colour, but usually the ridges on the cap of the Black Morel have fairly regular vertical lines unlike the randomly arranged honeycomb of the other two. The ridges on a Black Morel become darker than the rest of the cap, while in Common Morel and Morel they are paler (or sometimes bruise orange red). The Semifree Morelis very closely related, but it’s easily distinguished by it’s smaller cap that is attached to the stem halfway. The Black Morel (Morchella importuna) here described and the Semifree Morel (Morchella semilibera) are both part of a wider group colloquially called the “Black Morels”. The “Black Morels” are a large group (technically called acladeorsection) of very similar species, and mycologists still  haven’t established exactly how many species exist, their distribution, and how they differ from each other. The forager shouldn’t worry too much about precise distinction as all Black Morels seem to be excellent edibles.If you find a “Black Morel” with purplish or pinkish tones, not turning black with age, and growing under Pine or other coniferous trees, then you’re likely to have found the Purplish Morel (Morchella purpurascens).

Although wilder collections are tastier than the wood-chip counterparts, they’re still tasty mushrooms and very worth eating. They work well in a variety of recipes, in particular in rich sauces. As pointed above they need to be well cooked, so no lightly tossed Morels.",

Based on the phylogeny studies of He, Chen, Bau, Wang & Yang (2023), many rushed to move all the former Lepistaspecies into the genus Collybia, however, not everyone agrees with this change.He & Yang (2024)proposed to conserve the genus Clitocybeand place all the former Lepistaspecies into the genus Clitocybe, but as a section. It would definitely make sense, as Lepistaspecies were historically Clitocybespecies, and just later got their own genus.At Wild Food UK we aren’t taxonomists, and from a forager’s perspective these changes have no relevance, so we stick to the old genus name,Lepistafor our Blewits (and reserving the right of being wrong in this sense).",

When this was later examined it turned out to be a 5300 year old mummy that they named Ötzi. Ötzi had some Birch Polypore on a leather thong around his neck, he also had a parasitic intestinal worm called a Whipworm which can be cured with polyporenic acid which is one of the chemicals present in the Birch Polypore.Another possible use of the fungus by Bronze Age man was as a very good tinder that can be started with a weak spark or used to transport fire as the fungus can smoulder for a long time and can be used to take to the next camp or destination and get a fire lit quickly without the long and laborious task of lighting a fire by friction.Birchtrees contain betulinic acid which has many health benefits, there are also other chemicals in the Birch Polypore that are beneficial for being healthy. With modern research it is becoming clear that the Birch Polypore is an important mushroom to look into, tests have been carried out and so far found the following. Antiviral. In tests extracts from the Birch Polypore blocked reproduction in HIV cells, attacked and incapacitated encephalitis infections and has proved positive in treating flu, yellow fever and West Nile flu. Antibiotic. The Birch Polypore contains the antibiotic piptamine which has been used to treat e-coli. Anti inflammatory. There are several triterpene acids present and these are known anti-inflammatory substances. Anti Tumor. Betulinic acid and other chemicals in the fungi have been shown to cause apoptosis, the destruction of cancer cells while not affecting healthy cells. Antiseptic. For cleaning wounds and being an aid to healing. Antifungal. This mushroom does not like to share its habitat with other mushrooms and contains some powerful antifungals. Styptic. The fungus has styptic properties (it staunches bleeding). The mushroom has very beneficial effects on the immune system and many people drink a tea made from the fresh or dried fungi and swear by its positive effects.A plaster can be made from the underside of the mushroom, a strip needs to be cut and carefully removed from the pore membrane. This provides a microporus, anti fungal, antiseptic and self sticking plaster, much better than can be purchased from the shops.A corn or blister plaster can be easily fashioned from the flesh of the mushroom by cutting some flesh into a doughnut shape of the right size and applying to the corn or blister.The common name Razor Strop Fungus comes from the use in old barber shops of cutting a strip from the underside of the fungus, drying it and sticking it to a piece of flat wood. This was used to give the final finish to the cut throat razors that barbers used. I’m not sure if they were aware of the fact but in doing so they were giving their blades an antiseptic, antifungal and styptic wipe!The fungus has also been used in the past as very fine emery cloth to polish metals, making ink blotters and even bases for mounting insects for collections.Truly the Swiss Army knife of mushrooms.",

However we have also had reports of severe gastric upsets after consumption from Yew. In any case, the toxic alkaloids found in Yew are very resilient and can be found even on dead wood and fallen needles. Therefore specimens collected from Yew should be very carefully inspected, trimmed and cleaned thoroughly to remove any needles or wood debris trapped inside. At this point we cannot recommend collecting Chicken of the Woods from Yew as safe. It is a common fungus and you should be able to find it in other trees.

It would definitely make sense, as Lepistaspecies were historically Clitocybespecies, and just later got their own genus.At Wild Food UK we aren’t taxonomists, and from a forager’s perspective these changes have no relevance, so we stick to the old genus name,Lepistafor our Blewits (and reserving the right of being wrong in this sense).",

The Fibrecaps are identified by the radial fibres in the cap, the fibrous stem and the dull brown spore print. Most are little brown mushrooms and quickly dismissed by foragers. The toxin found in these mushrooms is muscarine which causes gastric upsets, excessive sweating and salivation, slower heart rate and can lead to death. The Deadly Fibrecap is known for containing a deadly amount of muscarine and deaths associated to this mushroom have occurred in the UK and Continental Europe in the past century. The antidote for muscarine poisoning is atropine, a substance better known for being the main toxin in the Deadly Nightshade plant. Those who have been poisoned by the mushroom should never attempt to use the plant as an antidote as atropine can be deadly itself and administration of medicinal dosage should only be done by a qualified professional.",

    "other_facts": "In the digestive system the gyromitrin is hydrolyzed into Monomethylhydrazine (MMH), a chemical better known for its use as a rocket propellant. The poisoning caused by MMH has a range of gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms. Serious cases lead to liver and kidney damage as well as seizures and coma, sometimes resulting in death. The amount of gyromitrin varies a lot from collection to collection but it’s usually very high. Consumed raw or in large amounts it can be fatal. However this mushroom and related species have a long history of consumption in parts of Europe and North America.Gyromitrin is volatile and soluble in water and it’s possible to remove most of it following a rigorous method. The processing should be done outdoors or on a well ventilated space to avoid inhaling the highly toxic vapours. We don’t recommend trying unless you understand very well the caveats associated with this species and toxin. There are many species of Gyromitraspread across the World, some more distinct than others. A couple of these contain high amounts of gyromitrin, others only contain trace amounts and some may not even contain the toxin. This leads to much confusion and debate among mycologists and foragers in different geographic areas. Most authors currently dismiss all Gyromitraspecies as suspicious, but in some areas the local species are regarded as edible after simple cooking. We use the term “False Morel” to specifically refer to Gyromitra esculenta, the most commonly recorded Gyromitraspecies in the UK. Enthusiasts see it as a derogatory term for this unique fungi, but this is the official common name sanctioned by the British Mycological Society.",

However, the main difference between these two closely related species is that P. melanopusmostly grows out of the ground as it is growing from buried roots of various hardwoods. It might also grow out of fallen branches of various hardwood species.Blackfoot Polypore (Cerioporus leptocephalus, syn:Polyporus leptocephalus), pictured, also has an almost entirely black stem and a rather wavy, centrally depressed cap (which is mostly dark cinnamon brown). Some authors treat Cerioporus varius, syn:Polyporus variusas a separate species, but we treat them as the same species as Blackfoot Polypore, because both of our references, A. Bernicchia and S.P. Gorjón, also A.E. Bessette et al. treats them as synonyms, and both of them refer them as C. leptocephalus.

Hallock (Ph D) in his book,A Mushroom Word Guide:Etymology, Pronounciation Aild food Uk & Meaning of over 1.500 Wordssays, the Greek word ‘Byssos’ or ‘Βύσσος’ refers to ‘a fine yellow flax’. Hallock forgot to mention that in Greek, ‘byssos‘ can also mean a fine linen made ofbyssos-flax, and that linen was also yellowish.Pat O’Reilly, the author of the book,Fascinated by Fungi, says “the genus name, comes via Greek from the Latinbyssus, meaning fine silk-like cloth and is probably a reference to the many fine maze-like ridges that pattern the surface of these fungi rather like interlocking jigsaw pieces, and-meruliusis the name (origin obscure) of the closely-related Meruliuscrust fungus genus.”We aren’t find the exact etymology of the word ‘Merulius‘, but the word ‘meruloid‘ means: wrinkled with uneven ridges.The epithet (the 2nd part of the scientific name) ‘corium‘ comes from Latin, and it means ‘leather’.",

It doesn’t have a long shelf-life, a few days after it hatched its egg, it collapses and rots into thesubstrate.Same as all the stinkhorns, this species distributes its spores with the help of insects. The mushroom attracts the insects with its rotting meat-like odour. When the insects land on the inner surface of the mushroom, its spores (trapped into a mucous layer on the inner wall of the individual arms of the ‘octopus’) attach to their feet and in this way they will leave the spores behind wherever they landing after this encounter.",

Below are our findings according to more recently published guides, but things are still likely to change: Pholiota adiposa– very slimy cap, no membranous skirt, prefers Beech;Pholiota cerifera– less slimy, slightly membranous white skirt, darker scales in base of stem, prefers Willow;Pholiota limonella– very slimy cap, more appressed scales, grey olive gills when young, prefers Birchand Alder;Pholiota jahnii– darker, slimy cap with more thorny scales, veil remnants on the edge of the cap, often growing on the soil from buried roots or wood debris. Pholiota adiposahas been reported as edible by some and in particular from China, however it is difficult to confirm if this refers to the same species, and some Scalycaps are reported as poisonous, so we can’t recommend anyone to try.",
