# Genus Profile Schema
# Use this template to build out the mycological knowledge base

genus: Russula
common_names: 
  - Brittlegills

confidence_markers:
  high:
    - Brittle flesh that snaps cleanly (like chalk)
    - No ring or volva
    - Attached gills, often brittle
    - Cap often brightly colored (red, green, yellow, purple, white)
  moderate:
    - White to cream spore print (most species)
    - Mycorrhizal with trees
  
ecological_context:
  habitat: 
    - woodland
    - forest edges
    - parkland with trees
  substrate: soil near trees (never on wood)
  associations: 
    - oak
    - birch
    - beech
    - pine
    - spruce
  season:
    UK: 
      - July
      - August
      - September
      - October
      - November

uk_occurrence: very common

lookalike_genera:
  - genus: Lactarius
    distinction: "Lactarius exudes milk when flesh is cut or gills damaged; Russula does not"
    danger_level: low
  - genus: Amanita
    distinction: "Amanita has volva at base, often has ring, flesh is NOT brittle but fibrous"
    danger_level: critical

key_species_uk:
  edible:
    - species: cyanoxantha
      common_name: Charcoal Burner
      notes: "One of the best - mild taste, flexible gills (unusual for Russula)"
    - species: virescens
      common_name: Greencracked Brittlegill
      notes: "Choice edible, distinctive cracked cap surface"
    - species: vesca
      common_name: Bare-toothed Brittlegill
      notes: "Good edible, gills don't reach cap edge"
  
  toxic_or_inedible:
    - species: emetica
      common_name: The Sickener
      notes: "Bright red cap, pure white gills, very peppery - causes vomiting"
    - species: foetens
      common_name: Stinking Brittlegill
      notes: "Smells of bitter almonds/marzipan, acrid taste"

notes: |
  Russula is an excellent genus for beginners because:
  1. Easy to recognize at genus level (brittle flesh test)
  2. No deadly toxic species in UK
  3. Simple taste test separates edible from inedible
  4. Very common - lots of practice opportunities
  
  Progression: Learn genus recognition → Master taste test → 
  Learn choice species (cyanoxantha, virescens) → 
  Learn to distinguish from Lactarius
