# Foraging Heuristic Schema
# Binary or near-binary rules that simplify identification/edibility decisions

heuristic_id: russula_taste_test
name: Russula Taste Test
category: edibility_determination

applies_to:
  genus: Russula
  confidence_required: high  # Must be confident it's a Russula first
  
prerequisites:
  - "Can reliably identify Russula genus (brittle flesh test)"
  - "Has NOT confused with Lactarius (no milk exuding)"
  - "Has NOT confused with Amanita (no volva, no ring)"

procedure: |
  1. Break off a small piece of the cap flesh (NOT the gills)
  2. Touch it briefly to your tongue, or chew a tiny piece
  3. Spit it out immediately
  4. Wait 30 seconds and note the sensation

outcomes:
  - condition: "Mild, nutty, pleasant, or no strong taste"
    conclusion: EDIBLE
    confidence: high
    action: "Safe to eat. Quality varies by species - some are choice, some are bland."
    
  - condition: "Peppery, hot, burning, or acrid"
    conclusion: REJECT
    confidence: high
    action: "Do not eat. Will cause gastric upset. Discard or leave."
    
  - condition: "Uncertain - slight tingle but not definitely peppery"
    conclusion: CAUTION
    confidence: medium
    action: "Treat as peppery and reject. Re-test with fresh specimen if available."

safety_notes:
  - "This test ONLY works for confirmed Russula specimens"
  - "Do not swallow the test piece"
  - "The peppery sensation may take 10-30 seconds to develop fully"
  - "Fresh specimens give clearer results than old/waterlogged ones"

exceptions:
  - species: olivacea
    note: "Can taste mild but causes GI upset in some people - avoid"
  - species: cyanoxantha
    note: "Flexible gills (unusual) - still use taste test as confirmation"

heuristic_id: bolete_blue_staining_caution
name: Bolete Blue Staining Check
category: safety_screening

applies_to:
  family: Boletaceae
  confidence_required: medium

procedure: |
  1. Cut the mushroom in half vertically
  2. Watch the cut flesh for 30 seconds
  3. Note any color change

outcomes:
  - condition: "No color change, or slight browning"
    conclusion: PROCEED_WITH_CAUTION
    action: "Continue to species identification"
    
  - condition: "Rapid blue staining"
    conclusion: INVESTIGATE_FURTHER
    action: "Check for red pores. If red pores AND blue staining, likely toxic Rubroboletus."
    
  - condition: "Blue staining AND red pores"
    conclusion: REJECT
    confidence: high
    action: "Likely Satan's Bolete or similar. Do not eat."

safety_notes:
  - "Many excellent edibles stain blue (Bay Bolete, various Leccinum)"
  - "Blue staining alone is NOT a reason to reject"
  - "Blue staining PLUS red pores is the danger combination"

heuristic_id: lactarius_milk_color
name: Lactarius Milk Color Test
category: edibility_determination

applies_to:
  genus: Lactarius
  confidence_required: high

procedure: |
  1. Break or cut the gills
  2. Observe the color of the milk that exudes
  3. Wait 5 minutes and observe any color change in the milk

outcomes:
  - condition: "Orange or carrot-colored milk, no color change"
    conclusion: EDIBLE
    confidence: high
    action: "Likely Saffron Milkcap (L. deliciosus) or similar. Choice edible."
    
  - condition: "White milk, stays white"
    conclusion: CAUTION
    confidence: medium
    action: "Species-dependent. Many are peppery/inedible. Avoid unless specifically identified."
    
  - condition: "White milk that turns yellow"
    conclusion: LIKELY_TOXIC
    confidence: high
    action: "Avoid. Several toxic species show this reaction."

heuristic_id: avoid_lbms
name: Avoid Little Brown Mushrooms (LBMs)
category: safety_rule

applies_to:
  morphology:
    cap_color: brown
    cap_size: small (under 5cm)
    gill_type: present
    
procedure: |
  If you find a small brown gilled mushroom and you're not an expert:
  Leave it alone.

outcomes:
  - condition: "Any small brown gilled mushroom"
    conclusion: AVOID
    confidence: high
    action: "Do not attempt identification unless expert level. Contains many deadly lookalikes."

rationale: |
  The "LBM" group contains hundreds of species including:
  - Deadly Galerina (Galerina marginata) - contains same toxins as Death Cap
  - Deadly Conocybe species
  - Various Inocybe (many toxic)
  
  Even experts struggle to distinguish these without microscopy.
  The risk/reward ratio is terrible - no LBMs are choice edibles.
