The combination of orange-pink cap with woolly margin, white milk, pale pink/salmon gills, and birch tree association is distinctive and diagnostic. All described features match the dataset entry with no contradictions.\n\nWhat could change this: if the cap margin is only slightly hairy (not distinctly woolly), it could be L. pubescens, which is paler overall. Both are poisonous, so the distinction doesn't change the safety advice.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nThe identification is already strong. To be fully certain, check whether the cap has concentric colour zones (characteristic of L. torminosus). A spore print would also confirm: L. torminosus produces a pale cream to pale pink spore print.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **Lactarius torminosus (Woolly Milkcap) is poisonous.** It causes significant gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea if consumed. While it is traditionally eaten in some Nordic countries after extensive parboiling in multiple changes of water, this is not recommended without expert guidance. Do not eat this mushroom raw or simply cooked."
