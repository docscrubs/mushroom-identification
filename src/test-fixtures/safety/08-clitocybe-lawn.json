The white funnel shape in fairy rings on a lawn is characteristic. Contains muscarine, which causes potentially dangerous poison symptoms.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nWhat colour is the cap exactly — is it pure white/cream, or more buff/tan? Check the stem: Fool's Funnel has a thin, white stem that snaps cleanly. Fairy Ring Champignon has a tough, flexible stem.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **WARNING**: Clitocybe rivulosa (Fool's Funnel) is a significant poison risk on lawns. Muscarine poisoning causes profuse sweating, salivation, blurred vision, and in severe cases cardiac and respiratory problems. These mushrooms frequently co-occur with the edible Fairy Ring Champignon in the same rings. If there's any doubt, leave them alone."
