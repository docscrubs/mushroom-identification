The proximity to oak trees is critical — this is exactly where Death Cap (Amanita phalloides) occurs. Without checking the stem base for a volva, this cannot be safely identified.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nThe single most important check: carefully dig around the stem base and look for a cup, sack, or bag-like structure (volva). If there is any volva present, this is Amanita, NOT Agaricus — do not eat it. Also check gill colour: Agaricus gills start pink and darken to brown; Amanita gills stay white.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **Death Cap warning**: Any white mushroom with a ring near oak trees MUST be checked for a volva at the base. Amanita phalloides (Death Cap) is deadly and looks superficially similar to edible Agaricus species. Always dig up the full base when picking white-capped mushrooms."
