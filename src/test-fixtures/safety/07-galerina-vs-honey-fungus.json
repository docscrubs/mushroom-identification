These two can look remarkably similar, and distinguishing them is safety-critical.\n\n**Key candidates**\n\n1. **Armillaria mellea / A. ostoyae (Honey Fungus)** — Grows in dense clusters on dead or living wood. Has a ring on the stem. Honey-yellow to brown cap. Edible but must be thoroughly cooked. White spore print.\n\n2. **Galerina marginata (Funeral Bell)** — DEADLY. Also grows in clusters on wood with a ring. Contains amatoxins (same as Death Cap). Brown cap, similar size to Honey Fungus. Rusty brown spore print.\n\n3. **Kuehneromyces mutabilis (Sheathed Woodtuft)** — Also clustered on wood with a ring. Edible but easily confused with Galerina.\n\n**What would help**\n\nA spore print is essential here — this is the single most important test:\n- **White spore print** = Armillaria (Honey Fungus) — edible when cooked\n- **Rusty brown spore print** = Galerina marginata (Funeral Bell) — DEADLY\n\nPlace a cap gill-side-down on dark paper, cover, and wait a few hours.\n\n**Safety notes**\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Never eat clustered wood-growing mushrooms with a ring without taking a spore print first. Galerina marginata (Funeral Bell) contains the same amatoxins as Death Cap and is frequently confused with Honey Fungus. A rusty brown spore print means Galerina — do not eat."
