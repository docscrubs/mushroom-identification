These two can look remarkably similar, and distinguishing them is safety-critical. A spore print is essential before any consideration of eating.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nA spore print is essential — this is the single most important test:\n- **White spore print** = Armillaria (Honey Fungus) — edible when cooked\n- **Rusty brown spore print** = Galerina marginata (Funeral Bell) — DEADLY\n\nPlace a cap gill-side-down on dark paper, cover, and wait a few hours.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Never eat clustered wood-growing mushrooms with a ring without taking a spore print first. Galerina marginata (Funeral Bell) contains the same amatoxins as Death Cap and is frequently confused with Honey Fungus. A rusty brown spore print means Galerina — do not eat."
