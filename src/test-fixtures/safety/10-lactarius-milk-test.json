The white colour of the milk is the most important safety feature to note.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nThe milk colour change test is critical right now:\n- Does the white milk change colour over 10-30 seconds? (Some species turn yellow, pink, or lilac)\n- Is the milk taste acrid/peppery or mild?\n- What colour is the cap, and what trees are nearby?\n\nThe key distinction: orange or carrot-coloured milk indicates the edible Saffron Milkcap group. White milk that stays white requires extreme caution — many toxic species produce white milk.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ The milk colour is critical for safe identification of Lactarius species. White milk does NOT mean edible — several toxic Lactarius produce white milk. Only orange/carrot-coloured milk indicates the edible saffron milkcap group. Even then, confirm the tree association (pine for L. deliciosus, spruce for L. deterrimus)."
