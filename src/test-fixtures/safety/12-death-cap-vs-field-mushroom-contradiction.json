No contradictions.\n**Edibility**: DEADLY — contains amatoxins causing fatal liver and kidney failure\n\n### Field Mushroom (Agaricus campestris)\n| Feature | You described | Dataset says | Verdict |\n|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|\n| Cap colour | olive green | white to grey-brown | CONTRADICTION |\n| Gills | white, free | deep pink when young, darkening to dark brown | CONTRADICTION |\n| Ring | skirt-like ring | thin, fragile ring | PARTIAL MATCH |\n| Stem base | bulbous with cup-like sack | no volva, tapered base | CONTRADICTION |\n| Habitat | under oak | grassland, meadows, pastures | PARTIAL MATCH |\n\n**Overall**: ELIMINATED — three core feature contradictions on cap colour, gill colour, and stem base structure\n**Elimination reason**: Olive green cap (vs white), white gills (vs pink/brown), and cup-like volva (absent in Agaricus) are all direct contradictions that definitively rule out Field Mushroom\n\n### Horse Mushroom (Agaricus arvensis)\n| Feature | You described | Dataset says | Verdict |\n|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|\n| Cap colour | olive green | white to cream-yellow | CONTRADICTION |\n| Gills | white | greyish-pink when young, darkening to dark brown | CONTRADICTION |\n| Stem base | bulbous with cup-like sack | no volva | CONTRADICTION |\n\n**Overall**: ELIMINATED — cap colour, gill colour, and volva all contradict\n**Elimination reason**: Olive green cap and cup-like volva are incompatible with any Agaricus species\n\n### False Deathcap (Amanita citrina)\n| Feature | You described | Dataset says | Verdict |\n|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|\n| Cap colour | olive green | lemon-yellow to greenish-yellow | PARTIAL MATCH |\n| Ring | skirt-like ring | ring present, large | MATCH |\n| Stem base | bulbous with cup-like sack | bulbous with gutter-like ridge, not sac-like volva | CONTRADICTION |\n| Smell | not described | distinctive raw potato smell | MISSING |\n\n**Overall**: ELIMINATED — the cup-like sack/volva structure contradicts A. citrina's gutter-like ridge base\n**Elimination reason**: True sac-like volva indicates A. phalloides, not A. citrina\n\n## Assessment\n\nThis is **Amanita phalloides (Death Cap)** with very high confidence. Every described feature matches the dataset entry perfectly, and all other candidates have been eliminated through feature contradictions. The olive green cap is the single most diagnostic feature — no common edible species has an olive green cap, and this colour is characteristic of the Death Cap.\n\nA single cap contains enough amatoxins to kill an adult. Symptoms are delayed 6-24 hours, by which time severe and often fatal liver damage has occurred.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nThe identification is already very strong with no remaining ambiguity. To achieve absolute certainty: confirm the volva is a loose, sac-like cup (not a gutter-like ridge). Take a spore print — Death Cap produces a white spore print.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT eat this mushroom. This is almost certainly Amanita phalloides (Death Cap) — the deadliest mushroom in the world. The olive green cap with white free gills, skirt-like ring, and sac-like volva under oak is the textbook presentation. This is a fatal species. There is no reliable antidote. If anyone has consumed this mushroom, seek emergency medical attention immediately and bring a sample."
