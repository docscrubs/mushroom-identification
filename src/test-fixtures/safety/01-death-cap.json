The combination of white cap, white gills, a ring on the stem, and a sack-like structure (volva) at the bulbous base, growing under oak, is the classic presentation of **Amanita phalloides (Death Cap)** — the most deadly mushroom in the UK.\n\n**Key candidates**\n\n1. **Amanita phalloides (Death Cap)** — DEADLY. Matches strongly: white-to-greenish cap, white gills, prominent ring, bulbous base with volva, and oak association. This is the most dangerous mushroom in the world. A single cap contains enough amatoxins to kill an adult. Symptoms are delayed 6-24 hours after ingestion, by which time severe liver damage has already begun.\n\n2. **Agaricus species (Field/Horse Mushroom)** — Some white Agaricus can superficially resemble Death Cap, but they lack the volva at the base and have gills that turn pink then brown.\n\n**What would help**\n\nTake a spore print on dark paper. Amanita phalloides produces a white spore print. Also check: are the gills free from the stem (not attached)? Is there a distinctive sweet, sickly smell?\n\n**Safety notes**\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do not eat this mushroom under any circumstances. The features you describe — white gills, ring, volva/sack at base, under oak — are the hallmark of Amanita phalloides (Death Cap), which is deadly and fatal. There is no antidote. Symptoms appear after a delay of 6-24 hours, by which time organ damage is already occurring. If you or anyone has consumed a mushroom matching this description, seek emergency medical attention immediately."
