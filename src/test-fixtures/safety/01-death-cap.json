The combination of white gills, ring, bulbous base with volva, and oak habitat is diagnostic. A single cap contains enough amatoxins to kill an adult. Symptoms are delayed 6-24 hours after ingestion, by which time severe liver and kidney damage has already begun. Do not eat this mushroom.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nDig carefully around the very base of the stem and confirm the volva (sac-like cup). Take a spore print on dark paper — Death Cap produces a white spore print. Does the mushroom have a faint sweet or honey-like smell?\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do not eat this mushroom under any circumstances. The features you describe are the hallmark of Amanita phalloides (Death Cap), which is deadly and fatal. There is no reliable antidote. Symptoms appear after a delay of 6-24 hours, by which time organ damage is already occurring. If you or anyone has consumed a mushroom matching this description, seek emergency medical attention immediately and bring a sample."
