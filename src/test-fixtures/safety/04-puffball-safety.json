Giant Puffballs can be 20-50cm across, which rules out Amanita confusion.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **MANDATORY CHECK**: Always slice any puffball-like mushroom in half before eating. Young Amanita (including the deadly Death Cap) can resemble puffballs in their button/egg stage. If you see any internal structure when sliced, it is NOT a puffball — discard it."
