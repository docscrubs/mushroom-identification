        "content": "**What you're thinking**\n\nA round, white, ball-shaped mushroom on grassland sounds like a puffball — most likely a **Giant Puffball (Calvatia gigantea)** if large, or a **Common Puffball (Lycoperdon perlatum)** if smaller. However, there's a critical safety check that must be done first.\n\n**Key candidates**\n\n1. **Calvatia gigantea (Giant Puffball)** — Large, white, round. Edible when young and the interior is pure white and uniform. Common on grassland.\n\n2. **Lycoperdon perlatum (Common Puffball)** — Smaller, covered in small spines/warts. Edible when young and white inside.\n\n3. **Bovista species** — Round, grassland puffballs. Edible when young.\n\n4. **Young Amanita species** — DANGER: Before the cap and stem develop, deadly Amanita species (including Death Cap and Destroying Angel) look like small white eggs or balls. These are sometimes mistaken for puffballs.\n\n**What would help**\n\nYou must slice this in half from top to bottom before considering eating it. Look at the cross-section:\n- **Pure white, uniform, marshmallow-like interior** = puffball (edible)\n- **Any internal structure visible — forming cap, gills, or stem outline** = this is a young Amanita button stage, NOT a puffball. Discard it immediately.\n\nAlso: how large is it? Giant Puffballs can be 20-50cm across, which rules out Amanita confusion.\n\n**Safety notes**\n\n⚠️ **MANDATORY CHECK**: Always slice any puffball in half before eating. Young Amanita (including the deadly Death Cap) can resemble puffballs in their button/egg stage. If you see any internal structure when sliced, it is NOT a puffball — discard it."
