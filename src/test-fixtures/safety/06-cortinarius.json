The brown cap under birch strongly suggests **Cortinarius rubellus (Deadly Webcap)**, which contains orellanine — a toxin that causes irreversible kidney failure. Symptoms are insidiously delayed by 3 to 14 days, by which time permanent kidney damage has occurred.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nTake a spore print — Cortinarius species produce a rusty brown spore print, confirming the genus. What colour are the gills? Young Cortinarius gills are often covered by the cobweb cortina and stain rusty brown from spores.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING**: Cortinarius species containing orellanine cause irreversible kidney failure with symptoms delayed by 3-14 days after ingestion. By the time symptoms appear, permanent renal damage has occurred. Some patients require kidney transplants. Do NOT eat any Cortinarius species unless identified by a professional mycologist."
