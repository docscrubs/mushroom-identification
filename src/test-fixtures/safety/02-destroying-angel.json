        "content": "## Initial Candidates\n\nStage 1 identified the following candidates based on pure white mushroom, white gills, ring, volva, and broadleaf woodland:\n\n- **Destroying Angel (Amanita virosa)** — high confidence — pure white with volva and ring in broadleaf woodland\n- **Death Cap (Amanita phalloides)** — medium confidence — also has volva and ring, but typically greenish cap\n- **Horse Mushroom (Agaricus arvensis)** — low confidence — white with ring, safety inclusion\n\n## Verification\n\n### Destroying Angel (Amanita virosa)\n| Feature | You described | Dataset says | Verdict |\n|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|\n| Cap colour | pure white | pure white, slightly sticky when wet | MATCH |\n| Gills | white | white, free | MATCH |\n| Ring | ring on stem | fragile ring, often disappearing | MATCH |\n| Volva | volva at base | large sac-like volva | MATCH |\n| Habitat | broadleaf woodland | broadleaf and mixed woodland, often with birch | MATCH |\n\n**Overall**: Strong match — all described features align perfectly\n**Edibility**: DEADLY — contains amatoxins identical to Death Cap\n\n### Death Cap (Amanita phalloides)\n| Feature | You described | Dataset says | Verdict |\n|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|\n| Cap colour | pure white | olive green to dirty yellow | CONTRADICTION |\n| Gills | white | white to cream | MATCH |\n| Volva | volva at base | large sac-like volva | MATCH |\n\n**Overall**: ELIMINATED — pure white cap contradicts Death Cap's olive/yellow-green coloration\n**Elimination reason**: Cap colour mismatch; Death Cap is olive/greenish, not pure white\n\n## Assessment\n\nThis is almost certainly **Amanita virosa (Destroying Angel)** — one of the deadliest mushrooms in the UK. Every described feature matches perfectly. Contains amatoxins — the same fatal toxin found in the Death Cap. A single mushroom can be fatal.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nConfirm the volva: dig carefully around the base — is it a loose sac? Also check for a faint sweet smell. Take a spore print — Destroying Angel produces a white spore print.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING**: This description matches Amanita virosa (Destroying Angel), which is deadly. It contains amatoxins that cause irreversible liver failure. There is no reliable antidote. Do NOT taste, eat, or handle this mushroom unnecessarily. The toxin is not destroyed by cooking. Symptoms are delayed 6-24 hours."
