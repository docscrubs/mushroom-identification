Both are deadly, containing amatoxins. The 5cm cap size firmly places this in the dangerous small Lepiota range. This should NOT be identified as a young Parasol.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nWhat is the exact cap diameter? The critical threshold: any Lepiota-type mushroom with a cap smaller than 10cm should be treated as potentially deadly. Does it have a strong or unpleasant smell (rubbery = L. cristata)?\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING**: Small Lepiota species (cap <10cm) are among the most dangerous mushrooms. They contain amatoxins — the same deadly toxins found in Death Cap. A 5cm cap is firmly in the dangerous range. Do not eat this mushroom. Multiple fatalities have been caused by small Lepiota species being mistaken for young Parasols."
