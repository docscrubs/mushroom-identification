The orange-pink cap with woolly margin and white milk is characteristic. Both L. torminosus and L. pubescens are poisonous and cause significant gastrointestinal distress.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nTwo key questions would narrow this down:\n1. What colour are the gills? (L. torminosus has pale pink/salmon gills)\n2. What trees are nearby — specifically, are there birch trees?\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ Both Lactarius torminosus and L. pubescens are poisonous and cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. The white milk is a warning sign — edible milkcaps (like L. deliciosus) produce orange milk. Do not eat this mushroom."
