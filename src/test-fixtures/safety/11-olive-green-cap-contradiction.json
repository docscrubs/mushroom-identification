Combined with white gills, a ring, a bulbous base, and growth under oak, this is a textbook description of **Amanita phalloides (Death Cap)** — the deadliest mushroom in the UK.\n\n**Diagnostic reasoning**\n\n- **Amanita phalloides (Death Cap)**: Strong match. Olive green cap fading to paler edges — matches exactly (\"olive green to dirty yellow or even tan brown\"). White gills — match. Ring on stem — match. Bulbous base — match (with volva). Under oak — match. No features contradict.\n- **Ruled out Field Mushroom (Agaricus campestris)**: The user described an olive green cap, but Field Mushroom has a white to grey-brown cap — this is a clear colour contradiction that eliminates it despite other superficially matching features (ring, grassland). Field Mushroom also lacks a bulbous base with volva.\n- **Ruled out Agaricus arvensis (Horse Mushroom)**: White to yellowish cap, not olive green — contradiction on cap colour.\n\n**Key candidates**\n\n1. **Amanita phalloides (Death Cap)** — DEADLY. All described features match: olive green cap, white gills, ring, bulbous base, oak habitat. Edibility: deadly poisonous — contains amatoxins that cause fatal liver failure. Confusion species: can be confused with Agaricus species by beginners, but the volva and white gills (never turning pink/brown) distinguish it.\n\n2. **Amanita citrina (False Deathcap)** — The lemon-yellow form can occasionally appear greenish. Less dangerous but still best avoided. Distinguished from true Death Cap by a more distinct bulbous base with a gutter-like ridge rather than a sac-like volva, and a strong raw potato smell.\n\n**What would help**\n\nDig carefully around the very base of the stem — is there a cup or sack-like structure (volva) around it? This confirms Amanita. Also, does the mushroom have a distinctive sweet or sickly smell? Take a spore print on dark paper — Death Cap produces a white spore print.\n\n**Safety notes**\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT eat this mushroom. The olive green cap with white gills, ring, and bulbous base under oak is the classic presentation of Amanita phalloides (Death Cap). This is a deadly species — a single cap contains enough amatoxins to kill an adult. Symptoms are delayed 6-24 hours, by which time severe liver and kidney damage has already begun. There is no reliable antidote. If anyone has consumed this mushroom, seek emergency medical attention immediately and bring a sample."
