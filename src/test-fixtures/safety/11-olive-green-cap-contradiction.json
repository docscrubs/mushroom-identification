The olive green cap is the key diagnostic feature that immediately distinguishes this from edible Agaricus species. Combined with white gills, ring, bulbous base, and oak habitat, every described feature aligns perfectly. A single cap contains enough amatoxins to kill an adult. Symptoms are delayed 6-24 hours, by which time severe liver and kidney damage has already begun.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nDig carefully around the very base of the stem — is there a cup or sack-like structure (volva)? This confirms Amanita phalloides. Take a spore print on dark paper — Death Cap produces a white spore print.\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING**: Do NOT eat this mushroom. The olive green cap with white gills, ring, and bulbous base under oak is the classic and deadly presentation of Amanita phalloides (Death Cap). This is a fatal species — there is no reliable antidote. Symptoms are delayed 6-24 hours, by which time severe liver damage has already begun. If anyone has consumed this mushroom, seek emergency medical attention immediately and bring a sample."
