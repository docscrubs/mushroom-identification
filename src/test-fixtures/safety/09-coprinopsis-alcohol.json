        "content": "## Initial Candidates\n\nStage 1 identified the following candidates based on grey cap with white scales, edges dissolving into black ink:\n\n- **Common Ink Cap (Coprinopsis atramentaria)** — high confidence — grey cap, deliquescent, ink-like dissolution\n- **Shaggy Ink Cap (Coprinus comatus)** — medium confidence — white scales, ink cap group\n- **Glistening Ink Cap (Coprinellus micaceus)** — low confidence — ink cap, smaller\n\n## Verification\n\n### Common Ink Cap (Coprinopsis atramentaria)\n| Feature | You described | Dataset says | Verdict |\n|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|\n| Cap colour | grey | grey to grey-brown | MATCH |\n| Cap surface | white scales | smooth to slightly scaly | PARTIAL MATCH |\n| Deliquescence | edges dissolving to black ink | cap auto-digests to black ink from edges | MATCH |\n\n**Overall**: Strong match — grey cap with ink dissolution is characteristic\n**Edibility**: Edible BUT dangerous with alcohol — contains coprine\n\n### Shaggy Ink Cap (Coprinus comatus)\n| Feature | You described | Dataset says | Verdict |\n|---------|--------------|-------------|--------|\n| Cap colour | grey | white with shaggy upturned scales | CONTRADICTION |\n| Cap shape | not described | tall, cylindrical, bullet-shaped | MISSING |\n| Deliquescence | edges dissolving to black ink | deliquesces from edges upward | MATCH |\n\n**Overall**: ELIMINATED — grey cap contradicts Shaggy Ink Cap's white/shaggy appearance\n**Elimination reason**: Shaggy Ink Cap has a distinctive white, tall cylindrical cap, not grey\n\n## Assessment\n\nThis is most likely **Coprinopsis atramentaria (Common Ink Cap)**. The grey cap dissolving into black ink is unmistakable for the ink cap group, and the grey colour points to C. atramentaria rather than the white Shaggy Ink Cap.\n\n## What Would Help\n\nDescribe the overall shape: Shaggy Ink Cap has a tall, cylindrical cap with prominent shaggy scales. Common Ink Cap has a smoother, oval/bell-shaped grey cap. Also, where is it growing — on soil, or on buried wood?\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n⚠️ **ALCOHOL WARNING**: If this is Coprinopsis atramentaria (Common Ink Cap), you MUST NOT consume alcohol for at least 3 days (72 hours) before or after eating it. Coprine blocks the enzyme that metabolises alcohol, causing a severe disulfiram-like reaction: intense flushing, racing heart, nausea, and vomiting. This includes all forms of alcohol — wine, beer, spirits, and even some medications containing alcohol."
