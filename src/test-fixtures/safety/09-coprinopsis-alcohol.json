The auto-digestion (deliquescence) where the cap dissolves into black inky liquid is the defining characteristic of this group.\n\n**Key candidates**\n\n1. **Coprinopsis atramentaria (Common Ink Cap)** — Edible on its own, BUT causes a severe adverse reaction if alcohol is consumed within 3 days before or after eating. Contains coprine, which blocks alcohol metabolism causing flushing, nausea, palpitations and vomiting (similar to Antabuse/disulfiram reaction).\n\n2. **Coprinus comatus (Shaggy Ink Cap / Lawyer's Wig)** — Edible and popular when young (before the ink starts). Taller with shaggy white scales. Does NOT cause the alcohol reaction.\n\n3. **Coprinellus micaceus (Glistening Ink Cap)** — Smaller, with tiny sparkling granules on the cap. Edible but not particularly worthwhile. Alcohol interaction unclear.\n\n**What would help**\n\nCan you describe the overall shape more? Shaggy Ink Cap (Coprinus comatus) has a tall, cylindrical cap covered in shaggy upturned scales. Common Ink Cap (Coprinopsis atramentaria) has a smoother, more oval/bell-shaped grey cap.\n\n**Safety notes**\n\n⚠️ **ALCOHOL WARNING**: If this is Coprinopsis atramentaria (Common Ink Cap), you MUST NOT consume alcohol for at least 3 days (72 hours) before or after eating it. Coprine blocks the enzyme that metabolises alcohol, causing a severe disulfiram-like reaction: intense flushing, racing heart, nausea, and vomiting. This includes all forms of alcohol — wine, beer, spirits, and even some medications containing alcohol."
